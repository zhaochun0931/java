In most cases, we use a keystore and a truststore when our application needs to communicate over SSL/TLS.

Usually, these are password-protected files that sit on the same file system as our running application. The default format used for these files was JKS until Java 8.

Since Java 9, the default keystore format is PKCS12. The biggest difference between JKS and PKCS12 is that JKS is a format specific to Java, while PKCS12 is a standardized and language-neutral way of storing encrypted private keys and certificates.





A Java keystore stores private key entries, certificates with public keys, or just secret keys that we may use for various cryptographic purposes. It stores each by an alias for ease of lookup.

Generally speaking, keystores hold keys that our application owns, which we can use to prove the integrity of a message and the authenticity of the sender, say by signing payloads.

Usually, we'll use a keystore when we're a server and want to use HTTPS. During an SSL handshake, the server looks up the private key from the keystore, and presents its corresponding public key and certificate to the client.

Similarly, if the client also needs to authenticate itself, a situation called mutual authentication, then the client also has a keystore and also presents its public key and certificate.





A truststore is the opposite. While a keystore typically holds onto certificates that identify us, a truststore holds onto certificates that identify others.

In Java, we use it to trust the third party we're about to communicate with.

Take our earlier example. If a client talks to a Java-based server over HTTPS, the server will look up the associated key from its keystore and present the public key and certificate to the client.

We, the client, then look up the associated certificate in our truststore. If the certificate or Certificate Authorities presented by the external server isn't in our truststore, we'll get an SSLHandshakeException, and the connection won't be set up successfully.















# generate keystore

$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias [youralias] -keyalg RSA -keystore [/preferred/keystore/path]
Use an [alias] and [path] of your choice.

The default keystore will be /root/.keystore




keytool -genkey -alias myjavassl -keyalg RSA -keystore ./myjavassl.keystore -keypass password -storepass password

keytool -genkeypair -alias myjavassl -keyalg RSA -v


# example:

# keytool -genkey -alias myjavassl -keyalg RSA -keystore ./myjavassl.keystore -keypass password -storepass password
