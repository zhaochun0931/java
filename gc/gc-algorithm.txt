The JVM provides four different algorithms for performing GC.


The serial garbage collector

The serial garbage collector is the simplest of the four. The serial collector uses a single thread to process the heap. It will stop all application threads as the heap is processed (for either a minor or full GC). During a full GC, it will fully compact the old generation.
