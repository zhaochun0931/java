🔑Keystore

A Java Keystore (keystore.jks or keystore.p12) is a file that contains:

The server’s private key (used to prove identity),

The server certificate (public key signed by a CA),

And optionally the full certificate chain.

👉 It’s what your Java application (e.g., GemFire, Tomcat, Kafka, etc.) uses to present itself to clients.







🛡️ Truststore

A Java Truststore (truststore.jks or truststore.p12) is a file that contains:

Trusted CA certificates (not private keys).
