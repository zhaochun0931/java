Creating a Thread

There are two ways to create a thread.

It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method:


public class App extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}









Another way to create a thread is to implement the Runnable interface:

public class App implements Runnable {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
