In Java, java.io.Serializable is not a class with methods or fields; it's a marker interface, meaning it doesn't require any methods to be implemented. It simply serves to mark classes that can be serialized.


Serialization in Java refers to the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes so that it can be easily saved to persistent storage (such as a file or a database) or transmitted over a network.



When a class implements Serializable, its instances can be converted into a byte stream using Java's built-in serialization mechanism.
