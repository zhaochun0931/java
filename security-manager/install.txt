The Security Manager worked based on a security policy file (.policy), which granted or denied specific permissions to code based on its source (e.g., location or signer). 
When an application performed a potentially sensitive action, the Security Manager would perform a check to see if that action was allowed by the policy. 

It has since been deprecated for removal, with its functionality permanently disabled in JDK 24. 


The removal process was executed in several steps via Java Enhancement Proposals (JEPs): 
JDK 17: The SecurityManager was officially deprecated for removal.
JDK 24: The Security Manager was permanently disabled. The related APIs remain for compatibility but have no functional effect.
