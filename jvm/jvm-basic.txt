Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an implementation of a virtual machine which executes a Java program.

The JVM first interprets the bytecode. It then stores the class information in the memory area. Finally, it executes the bytecode generated by the java compiler.

It is an abstract computing machine with its own instruction set and manipulates various memory areas at runtime.

Components of the JVM are:

Class Loaders
Run-Time Data Areas
Execution Engine
