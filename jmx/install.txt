JMX stands for Java Management Extensions. 

It is a Java technology that provides a standard way of managing and monitoring Java applications, system objects, devices (such as printers and disk drives), and service-oriented networks. 
JMX is a part of the Java platform starting from Java 5.





JMX architecture consists of the following key components:

MBeans (Managed Beans): These are Java objects that represent manageable resources. MBeans expose attributes and operations that can be accessed and invoked remotely

MBean Server: The MBean Server is the core component of JMX. It acts as a registry for MBeans and provides the management interface for accessing and manipulating MBeans. 

MX Agents: JMX Agents are Java applications or processes that host the MBean Server.

JMX Connectors: JMX Connectors enable communication between JMX Agents and management tools. Connectors define the protocol and transport mechanism used for communication. 
Common JMX connectors include RMI (Remote Method Invocation), JMXMP (JMX Messaging Protocol), and JMX over HTTP.
