===
The Logger object is responsible for representing the logging information. It’s the first mandatory layer in Log4j architecture. The Logger class is defined in package org.apache.log4j.

Generally, we create one Logger instance per application class to log important events belonging to that class. Also, we generally create this instance at the beginning of the class using a static factory method that accepts the class name as a parameter:


private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(JavaClass.class.getName());


Subsequently, we can use various methods of the Logger class to log or print important events depending on their categories. These methods are trace(), debug(), info(), warn(), error(), fatal(). These methods determine the level of a logging request.

The priority order of the Logger methods is: TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL. Therefore, these methods print the log messages depending on the logger level set in the log4j.properties file. This means if we set the logger level as INFO, then all the INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL events will be logged.





===
Appender denotes the destination of log output. We can print the log out to multiple preferred destinations using Log4j like console, files, remote socket server, database, etc. We refer to these output destinations as Appenders. Moreover, we can attach multiple appenders to a Logger.

Appenders work according to the appender additivity rule. This rule states that the output of a log statement of any Logger will go to all of its appenders and its ancestors – the appenders that are higher in the hierarchy.

Log4j has multiple appenders defined for files, consoles, GUI components, remote socket servers, JMS, etc.






===
We use layouts for customizing the format of the log statements. We can do this by associating a layout with the already defined appender. Thus, a combination of layout and appenders helps us send the formatted log statements to the desired destinations.

We can specify the format of log statements using conversion patterns. The class PatternLayout explains more about conversion characters that we can use based on our needs.






The log4j.properties file

We can configure Log4j using XML or the properties file. The log4j.properties file stores the configurations in key-value pairs.

The default name of the log4j properties configuration file is log4j.properties. The Logger looks for this file name in the CLASSPATH. However, if we need to use a different configuration file name, we can set it using the system property log4j.configuration.

The log4j.properties file contains the specifications of appenders, their names and types, and layout patterns. It also contains specifications about the default root Logger and its log levels.
