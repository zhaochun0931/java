Log4J is a popular, open-source logging framework written in Java. 


Log4j 1.x reached the end of life on August 5, 2015. Therefore, as of today, Log4j2 is the latest upgrade to Log4j.


There are three main components of Log4j – loggers, appenders, and layouts – that could be used together to print the customized log statements at the desired destinations.
