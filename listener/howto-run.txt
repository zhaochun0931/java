In Java, a listener is an object that implements a specific interface to "listen" for and respond to events. 
This is a fundamental concept for implementing the Observer design pattern, which is used for event handling and asynchronous notifications across many different Java frameworks. 

  
The core idea involves two main components:
Event Source: The object that generates an event (e.g., a button being clicked).
Listener: The object that implements the corresponding listener interface to handle the event. 

  
The listener is registered with the event source. When an event occurs, the event source calls the appropriate method on the registered listener object to notify it.
