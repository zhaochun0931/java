ParNew garbage collector is a parallel version of the Young Generation garbage collector used in the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine. 



ParNew is designed to perform garbage collection in the Young Generation space (where short-lived objects are allocated) in parallel across multiple threads. This improves performance by leveraging multiple CPU cores.

Concurrent with CMS: ParNew is often used in conjunction with the Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) garbage collector. In this setup, ParNew handles the Young Generation, while CMS takes care of the Old Generation.

As of Java 8, ParNew is the default garbage collector for the Young Generation when using the CMS collector.


JDK 9 and Later: With the introduction of the G1 garbage collector and other improvements, the usage of CMS and ParNew has declined. CMS is deprecated in JDK 9 and removed in JDK 14, so it's important to consider newer garbage collectors like G1, ZGC, or Shenandoah for modern applications.
