The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector was deprecated in HotSpot JVM version 9.0 and will likely be removed in a future release.

In Java 8, the CMS is the default garbage collector and tends to give the best performance characteristics with the lowest garbage collection pause times.

The CMS collector actually uses the Parallel New (ParNew) Collector of the Young generation and the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector of the Tenured generation.

Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Collector is actually a combination of two garbage collectors:

The Parallel New (ParNew) Collector of Young generation - It uses the 3-area (Eden, Survivor Space "From" and Survivor Space "To") algorithm parallelly with multiple threads in a stop-the-world fashion. It also has an internal 'callback' that allows an old generation collector to operate on the objects it collects

The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector of Tenured generation - It uses the "Mark-Sweep-Compact" algorithm with multiple threads concurrently with the application. A small portion is still running in a stop-the-world fashion.














The CMS Collector uses "ParNew" to represent Young Generation GC in log messages.
The CMS Collector uses "Old" to represent Tenured Generation GC in log messages.
The CMS Collector performs Old (Major) GC with multiple threads concurrently without stopping the application most of the time.
Application is stopped by the CMS Collector for Initial Mark and Final Mark steps of Major GC.
Application is stopped by the CMS Collector for Minor GC.
Application is stopped by the CMS Collector for Full GC.
The CMS collector is also called Low-Latency Collector, because it reduces the application pause time. But it may slowdown the application, because the GC is running concurrently with the application. It's a good choice for interactive applications like Websites.
ParNew collector is used to perform Young generation GC when "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC" option is used.
ParNew maintains a Tenuring Age Distribution list to determine object promotion to Tenured generation.
Tenured generation occupancy percentage initiates the CMS GC.
CMS Concurrent mode may fail, if Tenured generation gets fully occupied before it can finish the GC process.
The CMS collector does uses multiple threads for some phases in the GC process.
The number of threads in CMS parallel (stop-the-world) phases can be controlled by the "-XX:ParallelGCThreads=n" option.
The number of threads in 1 CMS concurrent phase, Mark phase, can be controlled by the "-XX:ConcGCThreads=n" option.
