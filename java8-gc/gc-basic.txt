A garbage collector is JVM component that is responsible for managing memory space primarily in the Head data area. 
It also manages memory space in Method Area and Direct Memory data areas. 
More specifically, a garbage collector has 3 major responsibilities.

Allocating Memory for New Objects

When the Java application is requesting to create a new data object (an instance of a class or array), the garbage collector must find a block of free space of a certain size in the memory. It is an easy task at the beginning, when the free space is a single continuous chuck. But when the free space becomes fragmented because of old objects are deallocated not in the same order as them were allocated. 
The garbage collector may have to move data objects around to put free spaces together into large chunks.
