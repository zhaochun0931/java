Tenured Generation Collection - Major GC

This section describes basic steps of a Tenured Generation Collection, also called a Major GC, which uses a simple 3-step Mark-Sweep-Compact algorithm on the entire Tenured Generation.


The basic algorithm used in Major GC is called Mark-Sweep-Compact, which consists of 3 steps:

Mark - Identify which objects are still live in the Tenured Generation and mark them.
Sweep - Identify and remove garbage by sweeping over the entire Tenured Generation.
Compact - Move live objects towards the beginning of the generation to combine fragmented free spaces into a single contiguous chunk at the end of the generation.


The Mark-Sweep-Compact algorithm is very straightforward as illustrated in the picture below:
