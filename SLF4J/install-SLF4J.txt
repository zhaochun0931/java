SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) is a logging abstraction framework for Java. It provides a common API for various logging frameworks (such as Log4j, Logback, and Java Util Logging).

SLF4J itself does not perform any logging; it simply acts as a facade or wrapper for actual logging implementations.

In simpler terms, SLF4J allows you to log messages using a common API, while the underlying implementation can be chosen at runtime (e.g., Log4j, Logback, etc.).
