-XX:+UseZGC



-XX:SoftMaxHeapSize=2048m

The SoftMaxHeapSize option sets a soft limit on how large the Java heap should grow. When set, the GC will try not to grow the heap size beyond this limit. But, the GC is still allowed to outgrow beyond the specified size if it really needs to perform certain operations such as to avoid OutOfMemoryError.

The size of this flag is set in the number of bytes.
Its value can not be set greater than the maximum heap size (-Xmx).
By default, its value is equal to the maximum heap size.





Changing SoftMaxHeapSize at runtime
The SoftMaxHeapSize option is also manageable, meaning it can be changed at runtime without having to restart the JVM. You can change a manageable JVM option at runtime using the HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean or jcmd, like this.

jcmd <pid> VM.set_flag SoftMaxHeapSize <size>
