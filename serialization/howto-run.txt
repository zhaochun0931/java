✅ 1. What is Serialization in Java

Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object into a byte stream so that it can be:

Saved to a file

Sent over a network

Stored in memory for later deserialization



Deserialization is the reverse: reconstructing the object from the byte stream.



Key Points:

The class must implement java.io.Serializable.

Transient fields are not serialized.

Used in Java RMI, caching, messaging, distributed systems.












How Java's native serialization works

For a class to be serializable using Java's built-in mechanism, it must meet these criteria:
  The class must implement the java.io.Serializable marker interface. This interface has no methods, serving only to "mark" the class as eligible for serialization.
  The class's non-static, non-transient fields are automatically serialized. static and transient fields are skipped.
  When an object is deserialized, the JVM creates a new instance and populates its fields directly. It does not call the object's constructor. 



The ObjectOutputStream class is used for serialization, and ObjectInputStream is used for deserialization.











# javac *
# java Main
Original object serialized: Person{name='John Doe', age=30, password='secret-password'}
Deserialized object: Person{name='John Doe', age=30, password='null'}
#



Notice that the password field is null in the deserialized object, because it was marked with the transient keyword and was not included in the byte stream.
