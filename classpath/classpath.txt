| `-classpath` or `-cp` | Defines where to search for user classes and JARs. |






1. -classpath /some/path/with/jars

This adds a single path to the classpath: the directory /some/path/with/jars, but not the JAR files inside it.

It means: “Java will look in that directory for .class files or a package directory structure, but not JARs.”

JAR files inside that directory will not be loaded automatically.

👉 Use this only if you have unarchived .class files or compiled packages in that folder.








2. -classpath /some/path/with/jars/*

This means: “Add all JAR files inside /some/path/with/jars to the classpath.”

This is how you correctly include multiple JAR files in a directory.

Each JAR inside the folder will be included (but not subfolders or JARs in subfolders).


java -classpath "/some/path/with/jars/*" com.example.MyMainClass

🛑 Note: You must quote the path or escape the * in some shells, otherwise the shell will expand it before Java sees it.
